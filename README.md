# Hotel.ua
### Final project for EPAM java course

------------------------

This project is a web application created for booking rooms in a hotel.
Customers can create a personal account, which gave them the ability to make a booking request or book a specific room.
But customers can not book any room without a personal account.

The request consists of such parameters:
- Number of guests
- Apartment class
- Arrival date
- Amount of days

Another role in Hotel.ua is a manager.
Manager main task is monitoring new requests, choosing the most suitable rooms for request,
and sending back a request to confirm the booking.

After successful booking the system creates a bill that has to be paid up, otherwise, it would be canceled in 2 days.
